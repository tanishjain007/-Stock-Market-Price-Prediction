## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the future stock prices using historical market data. The goal is to build a predictive model that can provide insights and aid in making investment decisions.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to accurately predict stock prices using machine learning techniques and evaluate the performance of different models.

## Dataset
- *Source*: [Mention the source of your dataset, e.g., Yahoo Finance, Kaggle]
- *Description*: The dataset includes historical stock prices with features such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, etc.
- *Preprocessing Steps*:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Handling Missing Values
  - Feature Engineering (e.g., creating moving averages)
## Methodology
1. *Data Collection*: Historical stock data was collected from [mention source].
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Performed EDA to understand the data patterns and relationships between features.
3. *Feature Selection*: Selected relevant features that have a significant impact on stock price prediction.
4. *Model Building*: Developed various machine learning models including:
   - Linear Regression
   - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)
   - Random Forest
5. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluated models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score.

## Technologies Used
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Model Development
- *Linear Regression*: A simple model to establish a baseline.
- *LSTM*: A deep learning model that captures temporal dependencies in time series data.
- *Random Forest*: A tree-based ensemble method that handles non-linear relationships well.

## Results
- *Best Model*: [Model Name, e.g., LSTM]
- *Performance Metrics*:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): [Value]
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): [Value]
  - R-squared: [Value]
- *Visualizations*: Include plots showing actual vs predicted prices, loss curves, etc.
## Challenges Faced
- Handling noisy data and outliers.
- Feature engineering for better model performance.
- Managing overfitting in complex models.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating more features like financial news sentiment analysis.
- Testing other advanced models like Transformers.
- Improving model generalization to different stocks and market conditions.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in predicting stock prices, with LSTM showing promising results. Future work will focus on enhancing the model's accuracy and robustness.
